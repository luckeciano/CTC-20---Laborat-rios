Exercises for "Discrete Structures for Computing" course.

In this repo, there are three programming exercises, written in C++.

# Groups, Subgroups and Hasse Diagrams:
* Implement an algorithm to find all subgroups given the table of a group;
* Build Hasse diagram from the lattice build by subgroups.

# Travelling Salesman Problem
* Implement Held-Karp's algorithm for exact solution to TSP using Dynammic Programming;
* Implement Brute-Force algorithm to verify the solution;
* Implement a random graph generator that receives as input the number of vertices and edges. The cost is
an uniform distribution with integer values in the range [1,10]. Simple graphs, undirected, no loops.
* Tests
  ** Verify the solution comparing HK's algorithm and brute force's algorithm to 10 random graphs with 6 vertices and 10 edges.
  ** Verify if detects the existance or hamiltonian cycle.
  ** Performance in memory and time for 10 executions.
